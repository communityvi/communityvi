# Communityvi Frontend

This is the frontend portion of the Communityvi project. It is one of the many access services for the synchronization server.

## How to get started

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```shell
$ npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
$ npm run dev -- --open
```

Now you can just edit any file, and the browser will auto-reload if necessary.

## Building

To get a production build, run:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
